## Election Audit Summary

### This script and the following analysis can be used in any election with some minor modifications. If the election was on a smaller scale, the script could be modified to look at city results instead of county results to get more granular details, if that level of information was provided in the data. Additionally, if the election commission wanted to instead see which county had the smallest turnout for an election, that could easily be modified as well.
